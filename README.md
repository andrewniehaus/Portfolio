## About Me
I am a Master's of Science in GIS student at Clark University, graduating in May of 2025. I grew up in Charlottesville, Virginia and have been living in Worcester, Massachusetts since I started my Bachelor's of Arts degree in Geography at Clark University in 2019. I am passionate about conservation, all things geography, and lifelong learning. 

I have over seven years of experience with GIS and varied  extracurricular experience working with multiple public and private companies/organizations. In addition to the technical skills outlined below, I pride myself on my abilities in communication, adaptability, self-learning, teamwork, and inquisitiveness. I excel in problem solving and taking a project end to end, expanding my technical skillset as required with efficiency, and communicating my results to non-GIS trained coworkers/stakeholders.
